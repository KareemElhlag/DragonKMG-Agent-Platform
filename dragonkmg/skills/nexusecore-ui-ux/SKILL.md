# NexuseCore UI/UX

> v2.1.0 adds the mandatory **Senior Monitor** post-work UX certification stage.

> Maintained and authored by **Karim (KaReem Elhlag) Abdelhady** for the NexuseCore UI/UX component and workflow standard.

This skill remains independently usable for frontend-only work, and has a defined collaboration mode with
`kmg-agent-skill`: for NexusCore feature work, load both skills when the change crosses data, API, tenancy,
permissions, persistence, runtime, or workflow boundaries. KMG owns engineering evidence and runtime truth;
this skill owns UX, accessibility, RTL, responsive behavior, and visual evidence.

## Required closing report

Every completed task must end with three explicit lines: **تم إنجازه** (implemented and verified),
**تم تحسينه** (quality, UX, performance, or maintenance improvements), and **المتبقي** (known gaps,
unverified areas, and the next highest-value improvement). Never mark an item verified without evidence.

Build interfaces that are calm, clear, dense enough for ERP work, and easy to extend. This skill is independent: it does not require or invoke `kmg-agent-skill`.

## Use when

- Creating, reviewing, or repairing a NexusCore page, workflow, form, table, dashboard, modal, navigation surface, or component.
- Improving visual hierarchy, RTL behavior, accessibility, responsive layout, or perceived quality.
- Introducing or extending shadcn/ui components in the existing React/Tailwind application.

## shadcn/ui usage

- Treat shadcn/ui as the preferred source for new primitives: add only the needed component with the shadcn CLI, then keep its source in `src/components/ui`.
- Use the existing NexusCore tokens, `cn()` helper, Lucide icons, RTL behavior, and accessibility conventions when adapting a shadcn component.
- Prefer composition and variants over copying a full design system. Do not overwrite `tailwind.config.js`, `src/index.css`, or existing shared primitives during initialization.
- Before adding a component, search `src/components/ui` and the existing custom primitives for an equivalent; extend one when that preserves behavior.
- For a new reusable component, use the component-creator procedure in [references/component-creator.md](references/component-creator.md). The creator must first locate an equivalent, then add one canonical primitive, a focused test, and a usage note before allowing feature-local copies.

Skip for backend-only work, data migrations, or purely mechanical changes with no visible behavior.

## Operating workflow

For any non-trivial screen or workflow, follow this order and keep the scope bounded:

1. **Map the user job:** identify the actor, goal, entry route, primary action, success result, failure recovery, and permission boundary. If the screen cannot be described as a short workflow, stop and clarify the structure before styling.
2. **Trace the data contract:** locate the route, query/mutation service, DTO/type, persistence source, and existing permission wrapper. A button is not implemented until its action changes durable state or navigates to a real, supported workflow.
3. **Choose one owner for each concern:** page orchestration in a page/hook, server communication in a service, domain state in the API, and rendering in components. Do not duplicate the same editor or mutation in dashboard, setup, and detail surfaces without an explicit reason.
4. **Design the states first:** loading, empty, error with retry, permission denied, disabled/submitting, saved, and stale/conflict. Empty data must not be presented as an unexpected server failure.
5. **Implement the smallest composable surface:** reuse existing primitives and tokens. Add a shadcn primitive only when an existing equivalent is absent; do not introduce a new wrapper for a one-off visual.
6. **Verify the real workflow:** test the route, permission, mutation, refresh/readback, keyboard flow, RTL layout, and mobile layout. Source inspection alone is not completion evidence.
7. **Run the consistency audit:** run `scripts/audit-ui.ps1` against the frontend. Treat duplicate primitives, feature-local copies of shared controls, missing reduced-motion handling for custom animation, and non-token colors as review findings.

8. **Run the UX performance loop:** use [references/ux-workflow-v2.md](references/ux-workflow-v2.md) to record the
   user job, route/data owner, interaction states, and browser evidence. Use [references/performance.md](references/performance.md)
   for a baseline and changed measurement; do not optimize from intuition alone.

## Operating rules

1. Inspect the existing design system, shared components, route, permissions, translations, and nearby screens before editing.
2. Prefer existing NexusCore primitives. Use shadcn/ui as a composable source for new primitives; do not replace Ant Design or custom components wholesale.
3. Keep business logic in hooks/services and keep visual components focused on rendering and interaction.
4. Use semantic HTML, visible labels, keyboard focus, error recovery, and screen-reader names. RTL must be structural, not a final text-direction patch.
5. Every data surface needs loading, empty, error-with-retry, success, disabled, and permission-denied states where applicable.
6. Optimize for repeated ERP use: scanning, comparison, keyboard flow, stable columns, restrained decoration, and predictable actions.
7. Avoid nested cards, oversized marketing layouts, decorative gradients/orbs, text inside icon-only controls without tooltips, and one-off colors that bypass tokens.
8. Keep layout stable with responsive constraints. Check long Arabic labels, narrow screens, dark mode, and mixed Arabic/Latin identifiers.
9. Prefer small composable components and tokenized variants over duplicated page-specific CSS.
10. Verify rendered behavior, not source appearance alone: run focused tests and inspect the page in a real browser at desktop and mobile widths.

## Anti-patterns that block completion

- A dashboard card links to a generic page while claiming to show tenant/store/module-specific data without passing and honoring a supported filter.
- The same business action is implemented twice with different persistence paths, especially JSON settings plus a relational endpoint.
- A preview is hard-coded or only updates local state while the saved configuration uses another shape.
- A success toast appears without a successful server response and a readback path.
- A visible control has no route, API mutation, permission check, or meaningful disabled/error state.
- A new page is added only to hide an existing broken flow; fix the owner workflow instead.
- A drawer, modal, button, table, field, or feedback surface is recreated inside a feature when an equivalent exists in `src/components/ui`.
- A custom animation changes layout, traps focus, or ignores `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- Responsive behavior is patched per page instead of being expressed by a shared primitive or layout contract.

## Workflow contract

For each changed workflow, record these facts in the implementation or task report:

| Contract | Required evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Entry | Reachable route and permission wrapper |
| Read | Loading, empty, error/retry, and tenant-scoped query |
| Write | Typed mutation, validation, authorization, and conflict handling |
| Feedback | Pending/disabled state and success/error message |
| Persistence | Refresh or readback proves the result survived |
| UX | Primary action, next step, keyboard focus, RTL and mobile behavior |
| Test | Focused component/route test; browser check when layout or interaction changes |

If one contract row is missing, report the gap instead of calling the feature complete.

## Central component policy

- `src/components/ui` is the single source of truth for shared interaction primitives.
- Feature folders may compose central components, but may not fork their behavior or styling.
- A component becomes central only when it has a stable API, an accessibility contract, and at least one focused test. Promote it when a second real surface needs the same behavior.
- Prefer one drawer/modal/table/form primitive with variants over several visually similar implementations.
- Motion is a shared behavior: use short tokenized transitions, preserve layout stability, and disable non-essential motion under `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- Every new primitive must document its intended use, forbidden uses, responsive behavior, and RTL behavior in the component creator record.

## Senior Monitor (mandatory post-work certification)

After implementation and normal review, run `scripts/senior-monitor-ui.ps1` and complete `SENIOR_MONITOR.md`.
Do not report the workflow complete until the UX certification decision is `CERTIFIED` or
`CERTIFIED_WITH_RESIDUE`. The monitor re-checks the user job, data contract, states, shared components, accessibility,
RTL, responsive behavior, performance, permissions, and browser evidence.

## Scripts

- `scripts/audit-ui.ps1`: scans a frontend for duplicated primitive names, feature-local modal/drawer/button copies, hard-coded color values, and custom animation without a reduced-motion branch. It is advisory and produces findings; it never rewrites source.
- Run it from the repository root with `pwsh -File <skill>/scripts/audit-ui.ps1 -FrontendPath nexusecore-web`.
- Use findings to decide whether to promote a component, compose an existing primitive, or document an intentional exception.

## Token discipline

- Read only the relevant reference for the current UI task.
- Search symbols and shared primitives before reading whole files.
- Reuse existing copy, tokens, icons, and test helpers.
- Do not create a design-system abstraction until at least two real surfaces need it.
- Report verification evidence and remaining visual debt briefly.

## v2 role routing

Select one primary role by the files and risk actually touched, then consult the other role when the change crosses
their boundary:

- [roles/frontend-architect.md](roles/frontend-architect.md): React, TypeScript, API state, browser performance, and
  security boundaries.
- [roles/ux-governance-reviewer.md](roles/ux-governance-reviewer.md): user jobs, information architecture, interaction
  states, accessibility, RTL, responsive behavior, and review/acceptance control.
- [roles/ui-platform-engineer.md](roles/ui-platform-engineer.md): shared components, shadcn/ui, tokens, rendering
  performance, visual consistency, and maintainable implementation.

All roles are software architecture/design and security-aware roles. Route by evidence, not by the screen's name. If a
role is not applicable, record why; do not load every reference for a small visual change.

## Required result

Before calling a UI task complete, confirm:

- The primary workflow is obvious without explanatory feature text.
- Actions, status, hierarchy, and next steps are visually clear.
- Arabic/RTL, keyboard focus, responsive wrapping, and contrast are acceptable.
- Loading, empty, error, and retry behavior are intentional.
- Shared components remain reusable and the change does not silently bypass permissions.
- TypeScript and focused UI tests pass; browser evidence is included when the task changes layout or interaction.
- The workflow contract above is satisfied, or every remaining gap is explicitly reported.
- A v2 UX record contains baseline/changed measurements, the route/data owner, the state matrix, and the remaining
  visual debt with a decision: `ACCEPTED`, `ACCEPTED WITH FOLLOW-UP`, `REJECTED`, or `BLOCKED`.
